More to do, not enough time to do it in. That said though, there is one thing that can always help you through it all. Friends.</p><p>Like most years I don&#x27;t know where I would be without some of my closest friends &amp; family to help me through some of the real hard times life throws at you. In comparison to last year it&#x27;s not been anywhere near as difficult but still had its fair share of ups &amp; downs none the less.</p><p>I want to take a moment to thank just a few of those who I don&#x27;t know where I would be or what I would do without them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/katiejjk">Katie</a>: My very best friend who has &amp; I hope will always be there for me</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/DanBennett">Dan</a>: You&#x27;re a twat. But a good twat.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Tactical_Sam">Sam</a>: I don&#x27;t know how you <a href="https://twitter.com/Tactical_Sam/status/854031251409391616?s=20">always make me laugh</a> when I am going through a rough patch</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Nether_Dweller">Toby</a>: I swear you&#x27;re like a brother to me with how much we have in common &amp; have been there for one another</li></ul><p>There of course many others who have been there for me &amp; I do thank all of you, but those 4 I don&#x27;t know what I would do without.</p><p>Now, on a more soppy side, there is sadly one person who isn&#x27;t here anymore but I never forget about.
At the beginning of 2020, before COVID19 took hold of the world, I lost a very close friend of mine: Jamie. I won&#x27;t go into details on it but I just want to take a moment to appreciate him, everything he did for us all, how insanely skilled he was at games &amp; how much I &amp; everyone else miss him.</p><p><strong>We all miss you Jamie <!-- -->❤️</strong></p><p><img src="images/new_years_2019.jpeg" alt="A photo from my 2019 New Years Eve party with Dan, Me, Sam, Jamie &amp; Katie" title="A photo from my 2019 New Years Eve party with Dan, Me, Sam, Jamie &amp; Katie"></p><h2 id="-experiences"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-experiences"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🌍<!-- --> Experiences</h2><hr><p>Now, for those who do not know me, I am an introvert.
Going out &amp; doing everything under the sun is not my thing. To me, especially as I have gotten older, I have found life is always moving so fast &amp; so much happening at once that any chance I can get to take a moment to slow down, enjoy the moment &amp; have some good memories, I will take it.</p><p>Not to say much didn&#x27;t happen in 2021, but as most years are now, most of my best experiences &amp; memories are had with friends online, not by going somewhere doing something.</p><p>The most frequent memories I have are clips saved from games played with friends. In the past year or 2 this has most prominently been <a href="https://playvalorant.com/">Valorant</a>.<br>
Here is just a few of my favourite clips from the past year of playing Valorant with my friends:</p><div class="relative w-full h-0 my-2 pb-[56.250%]"><iframe allowfullscreen class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full border-none rounded-lg overflow-hidden" frameBorder="0" height="100%" loading="lazy" src="https://streamable.com/e/o806r3?loop=0" title="What it&#x27;s like to play Valorant with Katie" width="100%"></iframe></div><div class="relative w-full h-0 my-2 pb-[56.250%]"><iframe allowfullscreen class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full border-none rounded-lg overflow-hidden" frameBorder="0" height="100%" loading="lazy" src="https://streamable.com/e/67lmnf?loop=0" title="You mean here?" width="100%"></iframe></div><div class="relative w-full h-0 my-2 pb-[56.250%]"><iframe allowfullscreen class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full border-none rounded-lg overflow-hidden" frameBorder="0" height="100%" loading="lazy" src="https://streamable.com/e/u6gr1f?loop=0" title="Dance party with Katie" width="100%"></iframe></div><div class="relative w-full h-0 my-2 pb-[56.250%]"><iframe allowfullscreen class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full border-none rounded-lg overflow-hidden" frameBorder="0" height="100%" loading="lazy" src="https://streamable.com/e/37g1ib?loop=0" title="WTF Katie" width="100%"></iframe></div><p>As for what other memories I have made in the past year? Well, I think it boils down to 2 big events I attended:</p><p>The first of which was the wedding of an old University friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/KnTElixar">Andrew</a> &amp; his now wife <a href="https://twitter.com/Calenmiriel_Art">Jade</a>.
Having not been to a wedding for several years now it was a nice occasion to go to &amp; celebrate the occasion.</p><p><strong>Congrats to you both <!-- -->🎉</strong></p><p><img src="images/andrew_and_jades_wedding.jpg" alt="A photo from Andrew &amp; Jade&#x27;s wedding with them standing outside in front of the church" title="A photo from Andrew &amp; Jade&#x27;s wedding with them standing outside in front of the church"></p><p>The second big event of the year is the group holiday I have with all my friends, usually to a family holiday home located in Norfolk.
Honestly so much happened on that week away that I cannot remember it all but I have a few photos to remember some of the best moments.</p><p><img src="images/norfolk_breakfast.jpg" alt="A photo of the full English breakfast we made on the day after we arrived" title="A photo of the full English breakfast we made on the day after we arrived">

With that going into 2021 I was finally able to work full-time &amp; earn a living with a paycheck.</p><p>As such there have been a number of larger purchases made this year that I was finally able to make after years of planning. There are 3 key purchases that I want to focus on:</p><h3 id="-macbook"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-macbook"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>💻<!-- --> Macbook</h3><p>After years of waiting I finally purchased <a href="https://twitter.com/nurodev/status/1463474778304622597?s=20">a new Macbook</a>.</p><p>Prior to this I have been using a 2016 15&quot; Macbook Pro which has served me very well over the years but has finally begun to show its age. Everything from general performance degradation, to battery life being less than a few hours (Even after a recent battery replacement). However the most fundamental issue with the device, as those who may already be able to guess, is the keyboard.</p><p>With a fair bit of saving, I was able to finally pull the trigger in October 2021 to purchase a new <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-silver-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb#">14&quot; Macbook Pro in silver with a top specification M1 Pro processor &amp; 16GB of RAM</a>. After receiving the device a month or so later I am beyond happy with the device &amp; believe it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I have made for my productivity in a very long time.</p><p>I have no benchmarks to validate it but this device with its 16 CPU cores &amp; 16 GPU cores I feel can in many scenarios stand toe to toe with my desktop Windows PC that&#x27;s running a <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-5900x">AMD 5900X</a> &amp; a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3060-3060ti/">RTX 3060 Ti</a>, all while staying cool &amp; silent the entire time. It&#x27;s mind boggling the engineering behind the device.</p><p><img src="images/macbook.jpg" alt="A photo of my new 14&quot; Macbook Pro in silver" title="A photo of my new 14&quot; Macbook Pro in silver"></p><h3 id="️-starlink"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#️-starlink"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🛰️<!-- --> Starlink</h3><p>The second big purchase of the year that came in at the very end was finally being <a href="https://twitter.com/nurodev/status/1468695438098374656?s=20">given access to the Starlink beta</a>.</p><p>For those unaware I live on a farm in a very isolated location and as such to get anything faster than ADSL I would need to pay BT around £20,000 to install a fiber cable to our location just to upgrade less than a handful of households. Since that wasn&#x27;t, and probably never will be an option, the other options were wireless or satellite broadband. There are no WISP&#x27;s in my area so that sadly rules them out &amp; standard satellite broadband is usually pretty slow &amp; has increased latency. As such, Starlink seemed like my best option.</p><p>A few hundred pounds &amp; a few days of shipping from California later I finally received my Starlink kit &amp; got it all set up &amp; running.</p><p><img src="images/starlink_box.jpg" alt="A photo of my Starlink kit delivered outside my front door" title="A photo of my Starlink kit delivered outside my front door">

The risk is of course a lot higher than a savings account, but the returns are that much higher I justified the risk &amp; only put in what I could afford to lose.</p><p>By the end of the year I am successfully up <strong>17.5%</strong> on what I have invested of the course of the year <!-- -->🎉</p><h3 id="-covid"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-covid"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>😷<!-- --> COVID</h3><p>I got COVID.

Even beginning to finally start using SQL, a language I have always heard of &amp; seen but only touch a handful of times before.</p><p>A lot can be learned from getting hands on with a production code base.</p><h3 id="-task-management"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-task-management"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>📋<!-- --> Task Management</h3><p>I&#x27;ve taken a huge liking to starting to track any &amp; all tasks I work on. Whether that be for something development based where I can create a new ticket in <a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a>, or something more personal like using <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to create a simple daily reminder list of everything I need to do that day.</p><p>So much of what I was doing before was quickly writing down something on a sticky note so I don&#x27;t forget it. But I ended up with a desk &amp; monitor full of them. So I&#x27;m glad I have finally learn&#x27;t to take a better approach to managing tasks &amp; work I do than forgetting tasks or having a rainbow desk made up of sticky notes.</p><h2 id="-targets"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-targets"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🎯<!-- --> Targets</h2><hr><p>It&#x27;s always good to try &amp; make some targets for yourself for the future.
Going into 2022 I have a few key areas I would like to focus on improving:</p><h3 id="-ship-it"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-ship-it"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🚢<!-- --> Ship it</h3><p>In the past year or so I have begun to follow &amp; see more about the indie hacker community. Bootstrapers, freelancers &amp; those building awesome projects from nothing. It blows my mind some of the amazing work being done by the community.</p><p>With that, in the past year or so, like most developers, I have had more ideas than time to build them. Too many ideas, not enough time. As such I have a list of possible projects to work on going into 2022. I am aiming to build &amp; launch/release a minimum of one, maybe two, projects or products in the space of the year.</p><p>For now I am aiming low as I have never launched or released a product before so it will be good to use it as an experience to learn not only how to do it, but how to do it better next time around.</p><p>Going to make <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> &amp; <a href="http://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> my new favourite tools in 2022.</p><h3 id="️-game-dev"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#️-game-dev"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🕹️<!-- --> Game Dev</h3><p>Games are a huge part of my life &amp; I spend way too much time playing them. But I wish I spent more time making them.</p><p>Having finished my Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Computer Games Programming, I know a majority of the fundamentals to build the tools to make a game, but not a game itself.</p><p>Graphics renderer&#x27;s, physics systems, sound engines, etc. All extremely complex systems that I studied in University &amp; know, to a certain extent, how to implement on my own. But when it comes to building an actual game to be played, I&#x27;ve only built a handful of them. As such I want to start putting a few prototypes &amp; game ideas I&#x27;ve had over the past year or 2 into practice.</p><p>Booting up Unity or Unreal Engine and starting to throw come C# scripts ot blueprints together to get an idea working &amp; see what I can put together.</p><h3 id="-work-ethic"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-work-ethic"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>💀<!-- --> Work Ethic</h3><p>I often find myself in between 2 working states. One where I feel like I am being lazy &amp; not doing enough or anything at all. The other being a pure workaholic where I end up pushing my mental &amp; physical limits to the edge &amp; working 12+ hour days.<br>
A prime example of this was in 2020 during the final stretch towards finishing my Bachelor&#x27;s degree at University. At the peak of the pandemic I will never forget me &amp; a close friend of mine, funnily enough also named Ben, being in Discord call&#x27;s for days at a time, sleeping 6-10 hours a week. I can safely say that that period of my life was worst state my physical &amp; mental health had ever been. All as a push to meet deadlines &amp; get the work done.</p><p>During 2021 that extreme &amp; detrimental mentality was near non-existent &amp; instead replaced with a much more laxed &amp; chill work ethic. Often to the point where I am not getting the work done that I needed to get done.</p><p>Going into 2022 I need to try and find a good work/life balance where I am able to manage my time effectively, get the work that needs to be done, done, but also not destroy my mental &amp; physical health in the process.</p><h3 id="-time-management"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-time-management"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>🕐<!-- --> Time Management</h3><p>Following on from the improvement in work ethic, I also need to take some steps in trying to improve my time management.
Currently my time planning is based around whatever I need to do next, I work on. A better method to try &amp; manage it better is starting to track the hours I work, timeboxing certain tasks, etc.</p><p>They&#x27;re all baby steps but they&#x27;re steps that need to be taken to start improving how I manage my time.</p><h3 id="-sleep-schedule"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-sleep-schedule"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>💤<!-- --> Sleep Schedule</h3><p>Ironic that I am currently writing about this at 3am but yes, for the past few months, or more so years now, I have been having issues maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.
Part of the issue is lying in bed waiting to fall asleep &amp; nothing happening, another part being not wanting to cancel the productivity spike. Not sure about others but I find myself most productive in the very early hours of the morning when there is no distractions. No noise. No people awake. Nothing but me &amp; the work that needs to get done.</p><p>I guess that goes without saying that improving my sleep schedule is partially linked to my improved time management. The two will go hand in hand.</p><h3 id="-others"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-others"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>📋<!-- --> Others</h3><p>There&#x27;s a few other smaller targets I&#x27;d also like to aim for:</p><ul><li>Fall further down the custom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">mechanical keyboard rabbit hole</a></li><li>Experiment with getting into 3D printing</li><li>Contribute more towards open source projects <!-- -->💚</li><li>Begin moving away from GSuite for self-hosted and/or more privacy focused alternatives</li><li>Try &amp; learn a new language while the <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> bird watches me in my sleep</li></ul><hr><p>And that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s a wrap for 2021.</p><p>This year has been had its fair share of bumps along the way, but nothing in comparison to what the world endured last year.</p><p>To finish it all up I want to thank all of those I spent the year with. Friends, new &amp; old, especially for helping make life that bit easier &amp; more bearable for me.</p><p><strong>See you all in 2022</strong>👋</p></article></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"frontmatter":{"banner_alt":"A photo of 3 cupcakes, each with a number on it to spell out 2021","banner":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1608870229932-cec85e0390ee?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026w=1738\u0026q=80","title":"2021 in review","description":"It's been a long year \u0026 a lot has happened so I wanted to recap it all","date":"December 31st, 2021","slug":"2021_in_review"},"source":{"compiledSource":"var m=Object.defineProperty,d=Object.defineProperties;var c=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,s=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var h=(t,a,o)=\u003ea in t?m(t,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:o}):t[a]=o,e=(t,a)=\u003e{for(var o in a||(a={}))r.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026h(t,o,a[o]);if(i)for(var o of i(a))s.call(a,o)\u0026\u0026h(t,o,a[o]);return t},l=(t,a)=\u003ed(t,c(a));var p=(t,a)=\u003e{var o={};for(var n in t)r.call(t,n)\u0026\u0026a.indexOf(n)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(o[n]=t[n]);if(t!=null\u0026\u0026i)for(var n of i(t))a.indexOf(n)\u003c0\u0026\u0026s.call(t,n)\u0026\u0026(o[n]=t[n]);return o};const makeShortcode=t=\u003efunction(o){return console.warn(\"Component \"+t+\" was not imported, exported, or provided by MDXProvider as global scope\"),mdx(\"div\",e({},o))},XStreamable=makeShortcode(\"XStreamable\"),layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(o){var n=o,{components:t}=n,a=p(n,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,l(e(e({},layoutProps),a),{components:t,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In the blink of an eye, the year is over.
